How to get it working:

• The FancyCypher.sh files requires mpv and lolcat to be installed on the system.

• In order for music to work, one must change file paths for the .mp3 files in the FancyCypher.sh file to wherever user puts them on their system.
• make the .sh file into executable script: chmod +x FancyCypher.sh

• Build the Main.java file and , fingers crossed, run it by ./Fancycypher.sh
